# Metaprogramming

## The M Word

### Ghost town and marketplaces

Source code contains variables, classes, methods, ... this is *language constructs.*

In many programming language, after compiler has finished its job, thinks like variables, methods just locations in memory. Can't ask class for its instance methods. In language such as C++, runtime is a quite place, a ghost town.

Meanwhile in Ruby, runtime is more like a busy market place. Most language constructs are still there. 

> You can walk up to language construct and ask it question about itself. This is called introspection.

    class Movie < ActiveRecord::Base
    end
    
    movie = Movie.create
    movie.title = "Doctor Strange"
    movie.title   # => "Doctor Strange"

Movie#title and Movie#title = 

There methods are nowhere to be found in the source code. How can title and title= exist if they're not defined anywhere?

You can find out by looking how ActiveRecord works. First the table name is straight forward. AR looks at the name of the class through introspection and then applies some simple conventions. Class name is Movie, AR maps it to a table named movies. (The library know how to find plurals for English words)

What about methods? AR defines them automatically. AR reads the schema at runtime, discover that movies table has two columns name title and director. So that AR defines methods such as Movie#title and Movie#title= out of thin air while the program runs.

> Metaprogramming is writing code that manipulates language constructs at runtime

Code Generator vs Metap.

Code gen means that you use a program to generate or otherwise manipulate a second, distinct program - and then you run the second program.

## The Object Model

### Class Definition

    class D
    	def x; 'x'; end
    end
    
    class D
    	def y; 'y'; end
    end
    
    
    
    obj = D.new
    obj.x    # => "x"
    obj.y    # => "y"

When the previous code mention `class D` for the first time, no class by that name exists yet. So Ruby defines the class.

At the second mention, `class D` already exist, so Ruby doesn't need to define it. Instead, it reopens the existing class and defines a method name y there.

You can always reopen existing classes and modify them on the fly. You can call this technique *Open Class*.

### The Problem with Open Classes

When you defined your own method, you may be override the original method, the method that some other part also use that method.

This is the dark side to Open Classes. They call those reckless patching of classes is *Monkeypatch*.

### Monkeypatch vs Open Classes

Use with good care, we refer to as Open Classes. lol.

Like any other global modification. Monkeypatches can be difficult to track  in a large code base. To minimize the danger of Monkeypatches, carefully check the existing methods in a class before you defines your own methods. 

Adding a new method is usually safer than modifying an existing one.

We can make it safer by *Refinements*

### Instance Variable

    obj.instance_variables

(?) Unlike Java, in Ruby there is no connection between an object's class and its instance variables.

Object of the same class that carry different instance variables.

### Methods

    obj.methods

Most object inherit a number of methods from Object. We can use Array#grep to check `my_method` is in object's list

`obj.methods.grep(/my/) #=> [:my_method]`

**WTF**: An object contains its instance variables and a reference to a class ... **but no method!**

![](Untitled-dfbb7075-4c9a-4da9-87b2-b7f5d1beee89.png)

instance variables live in objects; method live in classes
That's why objects of the same class share methods but don't share instance variables.

We should call:
"obj has a method called `my_method`"
" `my_method` is an *instance method* of MyClass"
not:
"MyClass has a method `my_method`", cause imply that you can call `MyClass.my_method`

## Class

Is an object (an instance of class Class), plus a list of instance methods and a link to a super class.

![](Untitled-c351398d-a9ac-4beb-b62e-0f2cfa71e68a.png)

### Constant

Ruby constant is actually similar to a variable - to the extend you can change the value of a constant, although you will get a warning from interpreter.

The different from a variable is scope. The scope follows its own special rules.

    module MyModule
    	MyConstant = 'Outer constant'
    
    	class MyClass
    		MyConstant = 'Inner constant'
    	end 
    end

![](Untitled-475a6256-0a8f-4267-91ba-dde5944ba5c7.png)

    Y = 'a root-level constant'
    
    module M
    	Y = 'a constant in M'
    	Y # => "a constant in M"
    	::Y # => "a root-level constant"
    end

## Loading vs Requiring

`load('display_info.rb')`

The `display_info.rb` file has variables and classes. Those will be removed when the file has finished executing. **However constant don't.** 

Can force to wrap the loading file in an anonymous module.
`load('display_info.rb', true)`
After code executing, Ruby will destroy the module.

`require` has a different purpose. `load` to execute code, `require` to import libraries. That's why requires has no second argument, those leftover class names are probably the reason why you imported the file in the first place.

`require` only load once, while `load` execute the file again every time you call it.

Quiz: MyClass < Object < BasicObject < nil

![](Untitled-640fa808-997c-4803-aab2-39c7ff922592.png)

The same with Module < Object < BasicObject < nil

![](Untitled-89950014-3397-40bb-9cc0-10e28d0bae5d.png)

When you call a method, Ruby does 2 things:

1. Finds the method: *method lookup*
2. Execute the method. Todo that Ruby needs something called *self*

## Method Lookup

When call a method, Ruby looks into the object's class and find the method there.

`receiver`: the object that you call a method on. Eg: `my_string.reverse()` my_string is the receiver

`ancestors chain`: Module < Object < BasicObject
The path of classes when we travel is the ancestors chain of the class.

    class MyClass
    	def my_method; 'my_method()'; end
    end
    
    class MySubclass < MyClass
    end
    
    obj = MySubclass.new
    obj.my_method() # => "my_method()"

![](Untitled-e559a262-52b4-4f23-8fa9-da56a5d98fd0.png)

### Module lookup

    module M1
    	def my_method
        'M1#my_method()'
    	end
    end
    
    class C include M1
    end
    
    class D < C; end
    
    D.ancestors # => [D, C, M1, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

![](Untitled-396a34e4-9d64-40f9-acc2-2ed19e8d57f6.png)

### Module include vs extend

    module M1
    	def my_method
        'M1#my_method()'
    	end
    end
    
    class C include M1
    end
    
    c = C.new.my_method() #=> 'M1#my_method()'

C → M1 → Object → ...
Method look up can find `#my_method` by travel up to `M1`

### ⚠️ Include vs Extend

    module M1
    	def my_method
        'M1#my_method()'
    	end
    end
    
    class C extend M1
    end
    
    c = C.new.my_method()
    NoMethodError: undefined method `my_method' for #<C:0x00007fa831098c20>
    Did you mean?  method

Using extend will import the module methods as class methods.

Ruby inserts the module in the ancestor chain of the singleton class of the `C` class.

This will work: `C.my_method`. But why?

`class C` is an object from `Class`
`c = C.new` is an object from `class C`
These 2 objects is different

    C.object_id     #=> 70180307387000
    C.new.object_id #=> 70180097246200 
    
    # NoMethodError: undefined method `my_method' for #<C:0x00007fa831098c20>
    # C:0x00007fa831098c20 is C.new

When using `extend`, `my_method()` is only available in `C.object_id     #=> 70180307387000`, the singleton class of the `C` class. That's why: 

    # NoMethodError: undefined method `my_method' for #<C:0x00007fa831098c20>

### Method Execution

    def my_method
    temp = @x + 1 my_other_method(temp)
    end

To execute this method, we need to answer:

- what object does @x belong to
- what object should we call `my_other_method` on

Both belongs to the `receiver`, the object that `my_method` was originally called upon. When we call a method, we need to send along a reference to the receiver. Thanks to this, Ruby can remember who is the receiver when it executes the method.

### the `self` keyword

Every line of Ruby code is executed inside an object, the current object. 

    class MyClass
    	def testing_self
    		@var = 10 # An instance variable of self my_method() # Same as self.my_method() self
    	end
    
    	def my_method @var = @var + 1
    	end
    end
    
    obj = MyClass.new
    obj.testing_self # => #<MyClass:0x007f93ab08a728 @var=11>

### What private really means?

    class C
    	def public_method
    		self.private_method
    	end
    	
    	private
    	
    	def private_method; end
    end
    
    C.new.public_method
    ❮ NoMethodError: private method ‘private_method’ called [...]

You can make above code working by removing the `self` keyword.

> You cannot call a private method with an explicit receiver, every time you call a private method, it must be on the implicit receiver - self

Note: explicit means done by the programer (you), has to write. Implicit means done by the compiler or the tool.

- You need an explicit receiver to call a method on an object that is not yourself.
- private method can be called only with an implicit receiver.

(?) Q&A: Let's test above rules!

- Can object x call a private method on object y if the two object share the same class?

    class A end
    
    class X < A
    	def x_private_method; end
    end
    
    class Y < A
    	def y_private_method; end
    end
    
    X.new.y_private_method
    NoMethodError: undefined method `y_private_method' for #<X:0x00007ff8ba298f78>
    Did you mean?  x_private_method
                   private_methods
    

No matter which class you belong to, you still need an explicit receiver to call another object's method.

- Can you call a private method that you inherit from a super class?

    class A end
    
    class X < A
    	def x_private_method; end
    end
    
    class Z < X; end
    
    Z.new.x_private_method #=> OK

You don't need an explicit receiver to call inherited methods on yourself.

### The Top Level

Every time we call a method on an object, that object becomes `self`. 
Who's `self` if you haven't called any method yet?

    self # => main
    self.class # => Object

As soon as you start Ruby, you are sitting within an object named `main` that Ruby interpreter created for you. This object is sometimes call `top-level` context. 

Nothing to do with `main()` functions in C and Java. FYI

### Class Definitions and self

In class or module definition (and outside of any method), the role of `self` is taken by the class or module itself.

    class MyClass
    	self # => MyClass
    end

### Refinements

    class String
    	def to_alphanumeric
    		gsub(/[^\w\s]/, '') 
    	end
    end

The problem with modifying class this way is that the changes are global. This change might become *Monkeypatch* and might break some unrelated code.

From Ruby 2.0, we can deal with this problem using *Refinement*. Begin by writing a module and calling `refine` inside module definition.

    module StringExtensions 
    	refine String do
    		def to_alphanumeric
    			gsub(/[^\w\s]/, '')
    		end 
    	end
    end

This code add new `to_alphanumeric` to method but a Refinement is not active by default.

    "my *1st* refinement!".to_alphanumeric
    ❮ NoMethodError: undefined method `to_alphanumeric' [...]

To activate the changes, you have to do so explicitly, with the `using` method

    using StringExtensions
    
    "my *1st* refinement!".to_alphanumeric # => "my 1st refinement"

Start from Ruby 2.1, we can call `using` inside module definition. The Refinement will be active until the end of module definition.

Refinement are similar to Monkeypatches, but they're not global. 

In the limited scope where it's active, a Refinement is as good as an Open Class or a Monkeypatch.

### (!) Refinement Gotchas

    class MyClass 
    	def my_method
        "original my_method()"
    	end
    
    	def another_method 
    		my_method
    	end 
    end
    
    module MyClassRefinement
    	refine MyClass do
    		def my_method
    			"refined my_method()"
    		end
    	end
    end
    
    using MyClassRefinement
    MyClass.new.my_method      # => "refined my_method()"
    MyClass.new.another_method # => "original my_method()"

The call to `my_method` after the call to `using` we get the refined version of the method, just as we expected.

However, the call to `another_method` is not get refinement.

    another_method → my_method → using → still unrefined version

the call to `another_method` happen before `using`, so it call the original, unrefined version of the method.

### (?) Quiz: Tangle of Modules

    module Printable 
    	def print
    		# ...
    	end
    	
    	def prepare_cover 
    		# ...
    	end 
    end
    
    module Document
    	def print_to_screen
    	    prepare_cover
    	    format_for_screen
    	    print
    	end
    
    	def format_for_screen 
    		# ...
    	end
    
    	def print 
    		# ...
    	end 
    end
    
    class Book
    	include Document
    	include Printable 
    	# ...
    end
    
    b = Book.new
    b.print_to_screen

`print_to_screen` is not calling the right `print` method.

(?) Which version of print get called? Try drawing the chain of ancestors on paper. How can we quickly fix?

- Answer

    ![](Untitled-f48fa09f-d11d-48b4-b99f-c5c67702cbda.png)

        Book.ancestors 
        # => [Book, Printable, Document, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

    When including two modules or more, the last included one will always **be inserted again right between the class and the rest of the chain**

    When call `b.print_to_screen`, b becomes self, and method lookup begins. 

    Ruby find `print_to_screen` method in `Document`, and that methods call other methods - including `print`

    All method call without explicit receiver are called on self, so **method lookup starts once again from Book (self's class) and go up until it finds a method name `print`**

    Quick fix is to swap the include order so that Document gets lower than Printable.

### Wrap up

- When you call a method, Ruby goes `right` into the class of the receiver and then `up` the ancestors chain, until it either finds the method or reaches the end of the chain.
- When `include` a module in a class, the module is inserted in the ancestor chain right **above** the class itself.
- When `prepend` the module, it is inserted in the ancestor chain right **below** the class.

## Methods

### Dynamic Methods

How to call and define methods dynamically. When you call a method, you are actually **sending a message to an object.**

    obj.send(:my_method, 3) #=> 6

(?) Why use `send` instead of the plain old dot notation?

With `send`, the name of the method that you want to call become just a regular argument. We can decide what method to call until the very moment **while** the code is running. This is called **Dynamic Dispatch**.

### Method name and Symbols

Symbols and strings belong to two separate and unrelated classes

    :x.class # => Symbol
    "x".class # => String

(?) Why symbol?

It's convention. Symbols are used as name of things, name of method. Symbols are **immutable,** you can change the characters inside a string, but you can't do that for symbols. 

You wouldn't expect the name of a method to change, so it makes sense to use a symbol when you refer to a method name.

    # rather than: 1.send("+", 2) 
    1.send(:+, 2) # => 3

### Privacy Metter

`Object#send` is very powerful. We an call any method with `send`, including private methods 😕

`public_send`: it's like `send` but can't call private method

### Defining Methods Dynamically

    class Computer
    	def initialize(computer_id, data_source)
        @id = computer_id
        @data_source = data_source
        data_source.methods.grep(/^get_(.*)_info$/) { Computer.define_component $1 }
    	end
    
    	def self.define_component(name) 
    		define_method(name) do
    			info = @data_source.send "get_#{name}_info", @id 
    			price = @data_source.send "get_#{name}_price", @id 
    			result = "#{name.capitalize}: #{info} ($#{price})" 
    			return "* #{result}" if price >= 100
    			result
    		end
    	end
    end

Sprinkling the Code with Introspection

to get rid of all `define_component`:

    define_component :mouse
    define_component :cpu
    define_component :keyboard

You can introspecting the `data_source` argument, to get all the methods:

    data_source.methods.grep(/^get_(.*)_info$/) { 
    	Computer.define_component $1 
    }

`Array#grep{ block }` 

- if we pass a block to grep, the block is evaluated (execute) for each element that matches the regex (regular expression).
- The string that matched the regex is stored in the global variable $1

### method_missing

When method is missing?

    class Lawyer; end 
    nick = Lawyer.new nick.talk_simple
    ❮ NoMethodError: undefined method `talk_simple' for #<Lawyer:0x007f801aa81938>

When you call `talk_simple`, Ruby goes to nick's class and look up for talk_simple in its instance method.

If it can't find it there, it searches up the ancestor chain into Object and eventually BasicObject.

If it can't find anywhere, finally Ruby call `method_missing` on nick, the original receiver. This time Ruby know that `method_missing` is exist, because it's a private instance method of BasicObject that every object inherits.

### Ghost Methods

When we need to define many similar methods, we can response to calls through `method_missing`. This is like saying to the object "If they ask you something and you don't understand, do this"

From the caller's side, a message that's processed by `method_missing` looks like a regular call, but on the receiver's side, it has no corresponding method. This trick is called a *Ghost Method*.

    class Computer
    	def initialize(computer_id, data_source)
          @id = computer_id
          @data_source = data_source
    	end
    	
    	def method_missing(name)
    		super if !@data_source.respond_to?("get_#{name}_info")
    		info = @data_source.send("get_#{name}_info", @id)
    		price = @data_source.send("get_#{name}_price", @id)
    		result = "#{name.capitalize}: #{info} ($#{price})"
    		return "* #{result}" if price >= 100
    		result
    	end
    end
    
    my_computer = Computer.new(42, DS.new)
    my_computer.cpu # => * Cpu: 2.9 Ghz quad-core ($120)

### respond_to_missing?

    cmp = Computer.new(0, DS.new) 
    cmp.respond_to?(:mouse) # => false

`respond_to?` calls a method named `respond_to_missing?` that is supposed to return true if a method is a Ghost Method.
(for easy to understand we could think `respond_to_missing?` to `ghost_method?`)

To prevent `respond_to?` from lying, override `respond_to_missing?` every time you override `method_missing`

    def respond_to_missing?(method, include_private = false) 
    	@data_source.respond_to?("get_#{method}_info") || super
    end

If the method we want to use is exists? We return true, to prove that we can handle the Ghost Methods. If it isn't, it calls `super`. In this case, super is the default `Object#respond_to_missing?` which always return false.

### ⚠️  Method missing trap

    class Roulette
    	def method_missing(name, *args)
    		person = name.to_s.capitalize 3.times do
          number = rand(10) + 1
    			puts "#{number}..." 
    		end
    		"#{person} got a #{number}" 
    	end
    end

When call `number` at the end, the `number` is out of scope and Ruby assumes that `number` must be a method call on `self` 😱 !!!

In normal circumstances, you would get an explicit NoMethodError but in this case you have a `method_missing`. The same chain of events happens again and again ... until the call stack overflows.

This is a common problem with Ghost Methods. You Ghost Methods handle calls which plain wrong.

### ⚠️  Blank Slates

When the name of a Ghost Method clashes with the name of a real, inherited method, the latter wins.

Can fix by removing that inherited class.

> A skinny class with a minimal number of methods is called a Blank Slate.

A way to get Blank Slate is to inherit from BasicObject. BasicObject has a minimal number of methods.

Another way is to remove a specific method from class by using 

- `Module#undef_method` : remove any method, including the inherited ones
- `Module#remove_method` : removes the method from receiver, but it leaves inherited methods alone

## Blocks

Blocks are just one member of a large family of "callable objects", which includes `proc` and `lambdas`

### The basic of Blocks

    def a_method(a, b) 
    	a + yield(a, b)
    end
    
    a_method(1,2){|x,y|(x+y)*3} #=>10

Can define a block with either curly braces or the do..end keywords.

Define a block only when you call a method. The block is passed into the method, and the method can call back to the block with the `yield` keyword.

Block can have arguments. When you `yield` to the block, you can provide value for its argument, just like when you call a method. A block returns the result in the last line of code it evaluates.

Within a method we can ask whether the current call includes a block: `Kernel#block_given?`

### Blocks Are Closures

Code that runs is actually make up of 2 thinks: the code itself and a set of bindings

![](Untitled-0014ab4e-e449-485f-8d47-ab731dcdebc1.png)

Bindings here means names that bound to objects.

    def my_method
    	x = "Goodbye" 
    	yield("cruel")
    end
    
    x = "Hello"
    my_method {|y| "#{x}, #{y} world" } # => "Hello, cruel world"

When creating the block, we capture the local bindings, such as x (outer scope)

Then we pass the block to a method that has its own set of bindings. This bindings also include a variable named x.

However the code in the block sees the x that was around when the block was defined, not the method's x

We can define additional bindings inside the block, but they disappear after the block ends

    def just_yield 
    	yield
    end
    
    top_level_variable = 1
    just_yield do 
    	top_level_variable += 1 
    	local_to_block = 1
    end
    
    top_level_variable # => 2 
    local_to_block # => Error!

Because of above behavior, we would say a block is a **closure**. 

> A block captures the local bindings and carries them along with it

### Scope

Ruby does not allow **"inner scope" to see variables from "outer scope"**. That kind of nested visibility doesn't allowed in Ruby. 

    v1 = 1
    
    class MyClass
    	v2 = 2 
    	local_variables 
    
    	def my_method
    		v3 = 3
        local_variables
    	end
      
    	local_variables
    end
    
    obj = MyClass.new
    obj.my_method
    obj.my_method
    local_variables

When program enter MyClass, v1 "fall out of scope" and no longer visible.

### Global Variables vs Top-Level

    def a_scope
    	$var = "some value"
    end
    
    def another_scope 
    	$var
    end
    
    a_scope
    another_scope # => "some value"

Global variables `$var` every part of the system can change them. Very difficult to track which part of your code changing that. So shouldn't use them.

    @var = "The top-level @var"
    
    def my_method 
    	@var
    end
    
    my_method # => "The top-level @var"

We can access a top-level instance var whenever `main` takes the role of `self`. When any other object is `self`, the top level instance variable is out of scope.

### Scope Gates

There are exactly 3 places where a program leaves the previous scope behind (scope change) and opens a new one:

- Class, module, method definitions: `class`
- Module definitions `module`
- Methods `def`

### Flattening the Scope

    my_var = "Success"
    
    class MyClass
    	# We want to print my_var here... 
    	
    	def my_method
    		# ..and here
    	end 
    end

How can we pass a variable through those spots?

Kind of hacky way I think, not really clean. The workaround is to write the keyword `class` to pass the Scope Gate.

    my_var = "Success" 
    
    MyClass = Class.new do
    	"#{my_var} in the class definition"
    
    	define_method :my_method do 
    		"#{my_var} in the method"
    	end
    end
    
    MyClass.new.my_method

**Replace Scope Gates with method calls**, allow one scope to see variables from another scope.

This is called `nested lexical scopes`, or `flattening the scope`, `flat scope`

### Share scope

    def define_methods 
    	shared = 0
    
    	Kernel.send :define_method, :counter do 
    		shared
    	end
    
    	Kernel.send :define_method, :inc do |x| 
    		shared += x
    	end 
    end
    
    define_methods
    counter # => 0 inc(4)
    counter # => 4

Both method an see `shared`, no other method can see `shared` because it's protected by a Scope Gate. This is call Shared Scope.

Not used much in practice.

### JS Closure

    1: function createCounter() {
    2:   let counter = 0
    3:   const myFunction = function() {
    4:     counter = counter + 1
    5:     return counter
    6:   }
    7:   return myFunction
    8: }
    9: const increment = createCounter()
    10: const c1 = increment()
    11: const c2 = increment()
    12: const c3 = increment()
    13: console.log('example increment', c1, c2, c3)

`increment` has a function definition and closure - the variables that are in scope, in this case the `counter = 0`

`increment()` will run the function with variables that are in closure

Notice that `counter` is not in global context, try `console.log(counter)` and you will get `undefined` :)))

`counter` context live inside `increment`'s closure, in it's own scope.

> The closure is a collection of all variables in scope at the time of creation of the function

### `instance_eval()`

    class MyClass 
    	def initialize
    		@v = 1
    	end 
    end
    
    obj = MyClass.new
    obj.instance_eval do
    	self # => #<MyClass:0x3340dc 
    	@v=1 # => @v # => 1
    end

The block inside `instance_eval do ... end` has receiver as `self`, so it can access the receiver's private methods and instances variables.

    v=2
    obj.instance_eval { @v = v } 
    obj.instance_eval { @v } # => 2

The block that passed to `instance_eval` is a *Context Probe*.

### ⚠️ Breaking Encapsulation

With *Context Probe*, doesn't it break all encapsulation? All visibility, no private data anymore. Isn't that A Very Bad Thing?

However in some case it will be useful. Like take a quick peek inside an obj from `irb` command line

### `instance_exec()` vs `instance_eval()`

    class C
    	def initialize
    	  @x = 1
    	end 
    end
    
    class D
    	def twisted_method
    		@y = 2
    		C.new.instance_eval { "@x: #{@x}, @y: #{@y}" } 
    	end
    end
    
    D.new.twisted_method # => "@x: 1, @y: "

You may assume that `D#twisted_method` can access both `@x` instance from C and `@y` from D in the same Flat Scope. 

However, instance variable depend on **self**.

The code inside the block has C is receiver, interprets `@y` as an instance variable of C which hasn't been initialized, as as such is `nil`. 

To merge @x and @y in the same scope, we can use `instance_exec` to pass @y value to the block

    class D
    	def twisted_method
    		@y = 2
    		C.new.instance_exec(@y) {|y| "@x: #{@x}, @y: #{y}" } 
    	end
    end
    
    D.new.twisted_method # => "@x: 1, @y: 2"

### Callable Object

Using a block is a two-step process. First define code inside a block `{ }` and just set a side, leave it there. Second, call the block (by `yield`) to execute the block.

    def my_method(a, b)
    	a + yield(a, b)
    end
    
    my_method(1,2) {|a, b| a*b } #=> 1 + 2 = 3

This kind of "package code first, call it later" mechanism is not just block. There are at least 3 other places in Ruby where you can package code:

- In a *proc*, which is basically a block turned object
- In a *lambda*, which is a slightly variation on a proc
- In a *method*

### Proc Object & Lambda

Although most things in Ruby are objects, blocks are not. With `Proc` you can pack into an object and execute it later.

    inc = Proc.new {|x| x + 1 }
    # more code... inc.call(2) # => 3

This is called `Deferred Evaluation`

`lambda` is just a little bit different:

    dec = lambda {|x| x - 1 } 
    dec.class # => Proc 
    dec.call(2) # => 1

You can create a lambda with the so-called "stabby lambda" operator:

    dec = ->(x) { x + 1 }

### The & Operator

Sometimes using `yield` is not enough. 

- You want to pass the block to another method (or even another block)
- You want to convert the block to a Proc

In both case, you need to point at the block and say: "I want to use this block!"

    def math(a, b) 
    	yield(a, b)
    end
    
    def do_math(a, b, **&operation**) 
    	math(a, b, &operation)
    end
    
    do_math(2,3){|x,y|x*y} #=>6

To convert a block to a Proc:

    def my_method(&the_proc) 
    	the_proc
    end
    
    p = my_method {|name| "Hello, #{name}!" } 
    p.class # => Proc
    p.call("Bill") # => "Hello, Bill!"

## Procs vs. Lambdas

### The way to create

Procs created with lambda are called `lambda` while the others are simply called `procs`.

We can use the `Proc#lambda?` method to check whether the `Proc` is a lambda.

### The way to return

In lambda, return just returns from the lambda

    def double(callable_object)
    	callable_object.call * 2
    end
    
    l = lambda { return 10 }
    double(l) #=> 20

Thinks like return inside block, finish the block only.

In a proc, rather return from the proc, it **returns from the scope where the proc itself was defined**

    def another_double
    	p = Proc.new { return 10 }
    	result = p.call
    	return result * 2 # unreachable code!
    end
    
    another_double # => 10

Thinks like you copy code in Proc and paste in outer scope, then return will be return from the scope where the proc is defined.

⚠️ Bug:

    def double(callable_object) 
    	callable_object.call * 2
    end
    
    p = Proc.new { return 10 }
    double(p) # => LocalJumpError

The program try to return from the scope where p is defined. Because you can't return from the top-level scope, the program fails.

### Argument check

    p = Proc.new {|a, b| [a, b]} 
    p.arity # => 2

What happens if you call this callable object with 3 or 1 argument?

lambda: ArgumentError
block, proc: ok

    p = Proc.new {|a, b| [a, b]}
    p.call(1, 2, 3) # => [1, 2]
    p.call(1) # => [1, nil]

If there are too many arguments, a proc drops the excess arguments. If there are too few arguments, it assigns nil to the missing arguments.

### Method Callable Object

Bound to an object. They are evaluated in that objet's scope. They can also be unbound from their scope and rebound to another object or class.

    class MyClass
    	def initialize(value)
    		@x = value
    	end
    	
    	def my_method
    		@x
    	end
    end
    
    object = MyClass.new(1)
    m = object.method :my_method
    m.call # => 1

(?) A lambda is evaluated in the scope it's defined in (it's a closure). 
A method is evaluated in the scope of its object.

### Unbound Methods

Methods that have been detached from their original class or module. You can turn a Method into an UnboundMethod by calling `Method#unbind` or `Module#instance_method`.

### Writing a Domain-Specific Language DSL

setup.rb

    setup do
      puts "Setting up sky"
    	@sky_height = 100
    end
    
    setup do
    	puts "Setting up mountains" 
    	@mountains_height = 200
    end
    
    event "the sky is falling" do 
    	@sky_height < 300
    end
    
    event "it's getting closer" do 
    	@sky_height < @mountains_height
    end
    
    event "whoops... too late" do 
    	@sky_height < 0
    end

redflag.rb

    def setup(&block) 
    	@setups << block
    end
    
    def event(description, &block)
    	@events << {:description => description, :condition => block}
    end
    
    @setups = [] 
    @events = [] 
    load 'events.rb'
    
    @events.each do |event| 
    	@setups.each do |setup|
    	  setup.call
    	end
    	
    	puts "ALERT: #{event[:description]}" if event[:condition].call 
    end

- initializes `@setup` and `@events`
- load `events.rb`
- The code in the events file calls back into `setup` and `event`, adding (block contents) elements to `@setup` and `@events`
- loop through event, for each event, call setup blocks then call the event

⚠️ Those top-level instance variables, `@events` and `@setups`, are like global variables in disguise. Why don’t you get rid of them?”

We can use *Shared Scope*:

    lambda {
      setups = []
      events = []
    
    	Kernel.send :define_method, :setup do |&block| 
    		setups << block
    	end
    
    	Kernel.send :define_method, :event do |description, &block| 
    		events << {:description => description, :condition => block}
    	end
    
    	Kernel.send :define_method, :each_setup do |&block| 
    		setups.each do |setup|
          block.call setup
    		end 
    	end
    
    	Kernel.send :define_method, :each_event do |&block| 
    		events.each do |event|
          block.call event
    		end
    	end
     }.call
    
    load 'events.rb'
    
    each_event do |event| 
    	each_setup do |setup|
    		setup.call
    	end
    	puts "ALERT: #{event[:description]}" if event[:condition].call 
    end
